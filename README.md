# Project

	The winning numbers of the lottery are expected to be completely random. If this is the case there is no way to predict them. However, if there is a correlation between the numbers that are drawn and the date that those numbers are drawn then there would be a way to predict them. Also, if there is a way to predict, to a certain extent, the numbers that will be drawn in the future from the information of the numbers that have been drawn in the past then there is a chance to have an advantage over other players of the lottery. This experiment will be focusing on the numbers that tend to be drawn more often than other numbers in Powerball lottery draws. The experiment will be analyzing the data of drawings that happened between the years 2010 to 2015. In October 7, 2015 the rules of the Powerball changed and more numbers were added to each drawing. The experiment will also only focus on the drawing of the “Five Winners,” that is the numbers other than the power ball. The reason for this is that the numbers in the power balls is different than the numbers in the “Five Winners.” Therefore, an attempt to predict the “next” lottery number drawing will not be made. However, an attempt at replicating the data gathered from the “Five Winners” between the years 2010 and 2015 will be made with the program R. Thus, the results of this experiment can be used as a stepping stone towards a precise and accurate simulation and prediction of the “Five Winners.”
